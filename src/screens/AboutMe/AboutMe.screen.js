      <h1>The short version</h1>
      <p>
        Ambitious and optimistic Full-Stack developer with a "nothing is
        impossible" attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmed as a hobby for 9 years. It's still a hobby, now I just get
        paid.
      </p>
      <p>Other passions include animals, nature, and food.</p>
      <h1>The rambling version</h1>
      <p>Full-stack developer located in the frozen wastes of Norway.</p>
      <p>
        I began my programming journey in 2012, when I wrote my very first Hello
        World script in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since I've been infatuated with technology and the creativity
        involved with building projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next 9 years I would continue to explore my love for technology
        and broadening my knowledge of programming. Creating everything from
        ambitious video games to software and tools used to improve the life of
        my friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of 2020, with my plans of working in the restaurant
        industry seemingly halted by the pandemic, I drowned myself in code,
        with a new ambition to put the skills and passion I had for programming
        to better use in a professional environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 2 years of hard work, filling any gaps and sementing the knowledge
        I had gathered over the past years of doing it as a hobby, I took my
        first job as a full-stack web developer and never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of technology, I spend my time hiking, fishing, and camping
        alongside my best bud Biscuit, enjoying the tranquility that Norwegian
        nature has to offer.
